## 1. Mermaid Live editor
When it is necessay to download the graphs as svg (very useful) or png, the graphics can be edited anywhere and then be pastes on [Mermaid Live editor](https://mermaid.live/).

## 2. Virtual Studio Code 
For editing more comfortably, [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be used with some extensions:

- [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)

- [Mermaid Markdown Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bpruitt-goddard.mermaid-markdown-syntax-highlighting)

- [Mermaid Graphical Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=corschenzi.mermaid-graphical-editor)

- [Mermaid chart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MermaidChart.vscode-mermaid-chart)

## 3. Notable

For my daily work I use [Notable's](https://notable.app) built-in editor. Notable is a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) notes organizer. Markdown is «a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents». Notes taken in Markdown can be inpedepently opened by different programs: you can create them with any app and open them anywhere with the same or different apps.

## 4. Filemaker
Right now I'm creating a DB in Filemaker for visually creating graphs: the user just fills in the nodes and a script creates the code around.


## 5. Mermaid integration in Filemaker

Russell Watson has an [introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qTCy0-7Jw) about how to integrate Mermaid into Filemaker and some [demos](https://dotfmp.berlin/sharedfiles/312/download).
